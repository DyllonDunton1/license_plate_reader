Creating two neural networks that will first use segmentation to crop a picture to the size of the license plate, then a second that will do classification on each character to produce a string

The segmentation model was designed by Jacob Wildes, while the Optical Character Recognition was designed by Dyllon Dunton. This is still a work in progress but is mostly done
